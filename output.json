    "generated_response": "Based on your consumption of methi dana, figs, and raisins, which are rich in iron and fiber, it seems you are making good choices for managing PCOS and your vegetarian diet. For your next meal plan, consider incorporating more leafy greens like spinach and lentils for iron, and nuts and seeds like chia or flaxseeds for healthy fats. Adding whole grains like quinoa or brown rice can also provide essential nutrients. Feel free to ask for more specific meal ideas tailored to your preferences.",
    "ideal_response": "Great job for having methi water, continue having it daily, it will help boost your metabolism. Varsha, but I also noticed that you are having figs and raisins but they are not prescribed in the diet plan, can I know why you have added them?"
